# three-random-words
A "three random words" password generator inspired by [NCSC guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/three-random-words) from 2021

## Wordlists
The wordlists used in this project are of varying length and quality. Typically the longer the list, the lower the quality of the words. By default the program uses english3.txt which is the shortest but most qualitative out of the packaged options.

- english3.txt contains 194k words. It can be found at http://www.gwicks.net/textlists/english3.zip.
- words_alpha.txt contains 370k words. It was created by GitHub user dwyl and can be found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.
- wlist_match1.txt contains 1.5M words. It was created by Keith Vertanen and can be found at https://www.keithv.com/software/wlist/wlist_match1.zip

You can add other wordlists by putting them in the wordlists folder and modifying the configuration file (This can be done in the program).
